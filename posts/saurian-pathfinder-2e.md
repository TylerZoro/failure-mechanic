## The Hidden Saurian Heritage for Lizardfolk in Pathfinder 2e

Hidden Saurians were once widespread as slaves engineered from multiple
[Lizardfolk](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=15)
Heritages by the Serpentfolk empires of old to perform acts
of brute strength. Only isolated pockets of this once common race are
found today, deep in the jungles of Garund and a few other isolated but
remote locations.

Hunted by humans and other races of Golarion, they developed a unique
defensive trait: the ability to assume a common form.

When you create your Hidden Saurian, choose a common
[Ancestry](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx) of medium
size. You gain:
