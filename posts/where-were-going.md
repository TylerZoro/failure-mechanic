Time of failure: 2020-12-16

## Well, we don't know where we're going

This blog is about failing. No, not in the bad way. It's about failing to get it wrong, failing to take the easy way out, failing to do what everyone else does.

In the coming posts you should see articles about:

* Game systems
* Adventures
* Mechanics

But what you won't see is articles about Internet drama, whose system is best, why X sucks or the top ten things your rogue can do when stuffed in bag. I leave the clickbait behind and just focus on what's interesting to me. Hows that sound?
