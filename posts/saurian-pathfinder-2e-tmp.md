## The Hidden Saurian Heritage for Lizardfolk in Pathfinder 2e

Hidden Saurians were once widespread as slaves engineered from multiple
[Lizardfok](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=15)
Heritages by the Serpentfolk empires of old to perform acts
of brute strength. Only isolated pockets of this once common race are
found today, deep in the jungles of Garund and a few other isolated but
remote locations.

Hunted by humans and other races of Golarion, they developed a unique
defensive trait: the ability to assume a common form.

When you create your Hidden Saurian, choose a common
[Ancestry](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx) of medium
size. You gain:

<div class="pf2 feat">
#### [Single Action] Mimic Ancestry (Chosen Ancestry) Feat 1

**Frequency** a number of times per day equal to your level

**Duration** 1 hour per level

**Prerequisites** Hidden Saurian Heritage

You may
transform yourself into a member of your chosen Ancestry by altering your
coloration, height, the smoothness of your scales, and even retracting your
tail and snout. The head scales of the Hidden Saurians have even adapted to
transform into something that looks like stiff hair.

You may choose this feat more than once, selecting a new Ancestry
each time.

The appearance of a given Hidden Saurian is always the same in their
mimicked form and is unique to a given individual.

### Additional Ancestry Feats

<div class="pf2 feat">
#### Flexible Mimic Feat 5

**Prerequisites** Mimic Ancestry

Your **Mimic Ancesry** ability is more flexible and can take on more than one
appearance.

If you attempt to use the [Impersonate](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=46)
action to appear as a specific person using
[Deception](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=5)
while transformed, then you do not require
a disguise kit and gain a +2 bonus on the check.

Changing appearance requires you to use your **Mimic Ancestry** ability
and thus requires that you have an available use-per-day
remaining.

<div class="pf2 feat">
#### Uncommon Mimic Feat 9

**Prerequisites** Mimic Ancestry

choose an uncommon small or large Ancestry.

<div class="pf2 feat">
#### Perfect Mimic Feat 13

than just appearance. You *become that Ancestry*. Temporarily gain

This boost is lost when you end the transformation.
